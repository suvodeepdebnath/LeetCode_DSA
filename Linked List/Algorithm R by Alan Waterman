// The reservoir sampling is a family of algorithms which includes several variants 
// over the time. Here we present a simple albeit slow one, also known as Algorithm R by Alan Waterman.

# S has items to sample, R will contain the result
def ReservoirSample(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  # fill the reservoir array
  for i := 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]

  # replace elements with gradually decreasing probability
  for i := k+1 to n
    # randomInteger(a, b) generates a uniform integer
    #   from the inclusive range {a, ..., b} *)
    j := randomInteger(1, i)
    if j <= k
        R[j] := S[i]
